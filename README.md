 ## NOte:Core react creates web APP which run s on single page (SPA), but when we need to create multiple pages we use router from react-router-dom  which gives us facility to make multiple page application using routers ,But actually working on single page .just routing in si gle html page by some actions 


 ## React----> 
1. uses router-dom    : for  multipage web app
2. uses React-Native for mobile App.

## npm vs npx vs yarn 
=> npx simplifies command. npm is the default package manager for Node. js, npx allows running packages without installation, and Yarn provides enhanced performance and additional features compared to npm. The choice between them depends on project requirements, performance needs, and personal preference.

# utility : 
1. create-react-app : it is a software which make a bundle of all files structure we need to  work with react.  THis is quite bulky .  it      gives  also those packages or files which  will not be used in our peoject and  makes bundle heavy. So now recomended to use vite or parcel.
2. vite or parcel   :also does same work as crrate-react-app but less heavy bundles for react.

# NOte: 
1. function or compoennt name should start withUppercase.
2. In the react app created by "vite" the  compoenet you are making are forced to have  file name with .jsx 
3. In the react app created by "create-react-app" , we use .js extension of file But   we can  also make .jsx extension of file if that file is returning jsx .
